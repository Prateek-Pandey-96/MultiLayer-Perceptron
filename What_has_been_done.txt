I have taken data containing 60 independent and 1 categorical dependent variable.I have applied DeepNeuralNets in my approach.
I have used four hidden layers and the results are shown on mse and accuracy plots.
Gradient descent has been used to reach the optimum solution and saturation is observed around 700-800 epochs.
Shuffling has been done from time to time to prevent any case of generalization.
